# 📩 SMS Spam Detection with Multinomial Naive Bayes

This is a simple machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm. The app is built with **Streamlit** for an easy-to-use web interface.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The model is trained using a labeled dataset of SMS messages.
2. Messages are preprocessed (cleaned, tokenized, vectorized).
3. The MultinomialNB model is used to predict whether a message is spam or not.
4. Users can input their own SMS message in the app to see predictions in real time.
